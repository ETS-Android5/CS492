# Skincam

Skincam is an android application that classifies the type of skin disease the user has.

In the main screen, we have a gallery button and a camera button.

When the user presses a gallery button, it will ask the user to choose a photo of his or her skin from the gallery and when the user presses a camera button, the user will be asked to take a photo of his or her skin.

The image file either from the gallery or camera will be given to the pretrained model to identify the psossible type of skin disorder the user might have.

The result will be displayed on the result screen along with simple description of the disease such as the symptoms and cautions.
